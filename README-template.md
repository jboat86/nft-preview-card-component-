## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Firstly, I named my classes using BEM to get started with using this naming convention. This is because i personally find its a neat naming convention tool to use, and also make your code more readable.

`html`BEM naming convention example:

<div class="avatar__img">
        <img src="/images/image-avatar.png" alt="avatar" />

`CSS` centering icons
I learnt how to center the view icon when placed in a container (overlay); code shown below:

.overlay\_\_img {
position: absolute;
top: 50%;
left: 50%;
transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}

### Continued development

For my future projects i will start to use css preprocessor such as Sass to challenge myself with using a new technology. I will continue to refine my skills in flexbox and grid.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me get used to the flexbox layout. I really liked this and will use it going forward.
